# 👋 Hi, I’m Cesar Rocha

I am an ocean scientist and faculty member at the [Universidade de São Paulo (USP)](https://www5.usp.br/), Brazil, broadly interested in small-scale physical processes in the ocean and their role in Earth’s Climate System.

- 🌎 **Background:** Originally from São Paulo and a USP graduate, I earned my Ph.D. in Physical Oceanography from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UC San Diego (2018).
- 🧑‍🔬 **Research Journey:**  
  - Postdoctoral Researcher at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (2018–2020)  
  - Assistant Professor at the University of Connecticut (2020–2023)  
  - Returned to USP as faculty in 2023

## 🧭 Research Interests

I investigate how small-scale physical processes in the ocean impact the global climate. My approach combines methods from applied mathematics and theoretical physics, and involves building theoretical and numerical models as well as analyzing ocean observations to understand fundamental physical phenomena.

- Ocean turbulence & mixing
- Internal waves & mesoscale dynamics
- Ocean role in Earth's climate

## 🛠️ Approaches & Methods

- Data from novel observational platforms and high-resolution numerical models
- Methods of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics

## 👟 Outside the Lab

When I’m not working, I enjoy running (currently training for my first marathon!) and spending time with family and friends.
